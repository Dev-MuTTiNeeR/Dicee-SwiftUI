## 🚀 Key Features & Learnings

In this project, I transitioned from UIKit to SwiftUI and explored:

* **SwiftUI Layouts:** Used `VStack` and `HStack` to organize UI elements.
* **Spacing & Alignment:** Mastered `Spacer()` and `.padding()` to create a balanced and responsive design across different screen sizes.
* **User Interaction:** Implemented `Button` actions to trigger game logic.
* **State Management:** Used `@State` property wrapper to update the UI dynamically when dice are rolled.
* **Asset Management:** efficiently handled image assets in Xcode.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Swift 5
* **Framework:** SwiftUI
* **Architecture:** MVVM (Simple View-Model structure)
* **Tools:** Xcode

## 📦 How to Run

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open `Dicee-SwiftUI.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
